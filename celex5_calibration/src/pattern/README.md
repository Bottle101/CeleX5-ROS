## Overview

An ROS node is provided to generate a **blinking chessboard** for calibrating the Event-based Camera(Dynamic Vision Sensor). It provides the support of `rqt_reconfigure` to control the size and blinking frequency of the chessboard. And provide to save it in ` .avi` video format.

## Build and Run

1. Build

   If you have not yet compiled the entire repository, clone the entire repository and compile it (skip this step if you have already).

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/celex_ws/src
   cd ~/celex_ws/src
   git clone git@github.com:kehanXue/CeleX5-ROS.git
   # Or with http: `git clone https://github.com/kehanXue/CeleX5-ROS.git`
   cd ..
   rosdep install -y --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro $ROS_DISTRO
   catkin_make # Or use `catkin build`
   ```

2. Run

   ```bash
   source ~/celex_ws/devel/setup.bash # Or source setup.zsh when you use zsh
   rosrun celex5_ros pattern_generator_node
   # In a new Terminal
   rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure #  Open rqt_reconfigure to config
   ```
   
   Normal operation without error. You can see that a window will pop up showing the blinking chessboard. At this time, you can adjust the parameters of the blinking calibration board through the `rqt_reconfigure` panel:

   - `square_size`: the length of each side of the squares in a chessboard. In pixels.
   
   - `row_corners_num`和`col_corners_num`: the number of interior points of the rows and columns of the generated chessboard.
   
   - `blinking_fps`: the blinking frequency / frame rate of the chessboard. It is a cycle before one flash and the next flash.
   
   - `static_board`: controls whether the checkerboard blinks.
   
   - `record_video`: click start to generate the video of blinking chessboard, and click (uncheck) again to stop recording the video. The frequency of the chessboard blinking in the video is consistent with the current `blinking_fps` parameter. Note that adjusting the `blinking_fps` in the process of generating video is invalid for the generated video, and **doesn't adjust the size of the checkerboard during the video generation processing!**
   
      The video will be generated under the current application running path:

## CeleX5-MIPI Intrinsics Calibration Demo

We use the blinking chessboard calibration board to calibrate the CeleX™ CeleX5-MIPI Event-based Camera.

**Calibration principle:**

By using the blinking chessboard, the CeleX5-MIPI camera can generate a chessboard like event frame, and then the traditional Camera Intrinsics calibration method can be used. Here [`camera calibration`](http://wiki.ros.org/camera'calibration/tutorials/monocularcalibration) calibration tool integrated in ROS is used for calibration, and Zhang Zhengyou-Calibration method is used internally. The calibration results are saved with .yaml file, .txt file and image frame for final calibration results.

1. First install `camera-calibration`.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install ros-kinetic-camera-calibration
   ```

2. Run `celex5_ros_node`:

   ```bash
   roslaunch celex5_ros celex5_ros_node.launch
   ```

   Open `rqt_reconfigure` panel, under **Event Off-Pixel Timestamp Mode** sensor mode, only keep `/celex5_mipi/display/binary_img` Image topic publishing messages, close other Image topics to reduce running consumption. Keep `/celex5_mipi/display/binary_img` publishing frequency at 20 fps, too high can cause a delay in the calibration procedure.

3. Launch `camera-calibration`.  For the detailed meaning and more usage of each parameter, please go to the official document of `camera-calibration` in the above link. 

   ```bash
   rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x6 --square 0.0212 image:=/celex5_mipi/display/binary_img
   ```

   The meaning of parameters:

   - `--size`: The number of inner points (that is, the number of squares in the outer circle with the longest side out - 1), width*height. If this parameter is not set correctly, the calibration procedure will be found to be unresponsive in the following calibration steps.
   - `--square`: the physical length of each side of the squares in the calibration board. The unit is m.
   - `image:=`: Image topic name.

   After successful operation, the following windows will appear:

   <img src="assets/Screenshot from 2020-02-04 23-11-53.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

   Move the blinking chessboard screen, and make the X, Y, Size and Skew  progress bars in the upper right corner full and green as much as  possible. 

   Reference the [official document of `camera-calibration`](http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration/Tutorials/MonocularCalibration): 

   - checkerboard on the camera's left, right, top and bottom of field of view
   - X bar - left/right in field of view
   - Y bar - top/bottom in field of view
   - Size bar - toward/away and tilt from the camera
   - checkerboard filling the whole field of view
   - checkerboard tilted to the left, right, top and bottom (Skew)
   
*Tips: In the process of moving, the blinking chessboard pattern can be suspended, so as to avoid corner detection when the dragging is serious. After fixing the position, continue to make the checkerboard blinking to obtain a high-quality Event frame* 
   
   When you see the **CALIBRATE** button turns green, click calculate to get the internal parameter calibration result. Then click the **SAVE** button to save the calibration results. It will prompt you to save the path, which is a compressed package. After decompression, the image frame used in the calibration process and calibration result file (one .yaml file and one .txt file) are stored.
