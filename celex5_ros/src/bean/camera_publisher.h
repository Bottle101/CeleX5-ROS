 *  Create this class because of the Segfault of image_transport.
 *  gdb outputs:
 *  ```
 *  ROS__GI___libc_free (mem=0x3e646e657065645f) at malloc.c:2951
 *  2951	malloc.c: No such file or directory.
 *  ```
 *  Same problem can be found:

 *  https://answers.ros.org/question/275615/image_transportimagetransport-segfault/
 *  But my sysytem libboost version is 1.58, which is same to the pluginlib's dependence,
 *  and there seems to `link to different version libboost` doesn't happened.
 *  Still debuging...
